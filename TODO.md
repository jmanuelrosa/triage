# openwith — TODO

Chronological task list. Plan: `~/.claude/plans/i-would-like-to-bright-pixel.md`.
Tick items off as you finish them. Skip ahead only if the item is genuinely independent.

---

## Phase 0 — De-risk (do first)

Validate the assumptions that could kill the architecture before writing real code.

- [x] **POC: `.accessory` app as default browser** ✅ 2026-05-08
  Built `poc/openwith-poc.app`. Confirmed URLs route to it once selected as default. Two non-obvious gotchas surfaced:
  - `LSUIElement = true` in Info.plist excludes the app from System Settings → Default web browser picker. Use runtime `setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` instead.
  - `CFBundleDocumentTypes` declaring `public.html` as Viewer is required to be recognized as a "browser" (not just an http URL handler). Confirmed via Chrome and Helium Info.plist comparison.
  - Register `kAEGetURL` handler in `applicationWillFinishLaunching`, NOT `Did` — cold-launch URLs arrive before `Did`.

- [x] **POC: source-app detection across senders** ✅ 2026-05-08 (with caveat)
  `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` is **unreliable** — macOS activates us when launching us to handle a URL, so frontmost reads as ourselves. **Use Apple Event `keySenderPIDAttr` (`'spid'`) instead** — extracts the originating process PID directly from the event. Verified across Slack, WhatsApp, Notion — all return canonical bundle IDs (no helpers).
  *Edge case (Phase 2 fallback):* `open <url>` from Terminal reports `/usr/bin/open` PID, which is short-lived and gone before `NSRunningApplication(processIdentifier:)` can resolve it. Plan B: read process info via `sysctl(KERN_PROC, KERN_PROC_PID, …)` at event receipt to capture path/parent before exit, or maintain a workspace-activation history as fallback when sender PID resolves to nil.

- [x] **Spike: Helium bundle ID** ✅ 2026-05-08
  `net.imput.helium` (confirmed via `plutil` on Helium's Info.plist). URL invocation pattern still to be tested in the Chrome spike step.

- [x] **Spike: Chrome profile flag** ✅ 2026-05-08
  `open -na "Google Chrome" --args --profile-directory="Profile 4" "https://example.com"` works. Decision made to use **friendly profile names** in YAML (e.g. `"Jose Manuel [Dev]"`); openwith resolves them via Chrome's `Local State` JSON at launch time. Falls back to literal directory name if no display match.

  Available local profiles:
  - `Default` → josemanuel.rosamoncayo@gmail.com
  - `Profile 4` → Jose Manuel [Dev]
  - `Profile 5` → Donde la locura
  - `Profile 8` → 3bitslost
  - `Profile 9` → aoiTo

  *Open question (still unresolved):* No Didomi work profile in this list — needs clarification before Phase 1 YAML rules can target the work flow.

---

## Phase 1 — Scaffold ✅ 2026-05-08

- [x] SwiftPM project at project root (`Package.swift`, `Sources/openwith/`, `Resources/Info.plist`, `Scripts/build.sh`)
- [x] Yams 5.4.0 pinned via `Package.resolved`
- [x] `Resources/Info.plist` with all Phase 0 gotchas baked in (no `LSUIElement`, `CFBundleDocumentTypes` for `public.html`/`public.xhtml`/`public.url`)
- [x] `main.swift` bootstraps `NSApplication` with `.accessory` policy
- [x] `AppDelegate.swift` registers `kAEGetURL` in `applicationWillFinishLaunching`, logs URL + AE sender PID (Phase 0 behavior, real project structure)
- [x] `Scripts/build.sh` runs `swift build` then assembles `.app` bundle with ad-hoc codesign
- [x] `git init -b main` + initial commit + Yams pin commit

---

## Phase 2 — Core implementation

Build inside-out: pure logic first (testable), then I/O, then UI.

- [x] `RuleMatcher.swift` ✅ 2026-05-08 — host glob + path glob + source-app (bundle ID or display name), first-match-wins, case-insensitive everywhere. Lives in new `OpenWithCore` library target.
- [x] `Tests/OpenWithCoreTests/RuleMatcherTests.swift` ✅ 2026-05-08 — 25 swift-testing cases (XCTest needs full Xcode; CLT-only setup uses swift-testing as an explicit SwiftPM dep).
- [x] `Config.swift` ✅ 2026-05-08 — Yams decode, validation (every rule must reference a declared browser), `Config.parse(yaml:)` + `Config.load(from:)`, structured `ConfigError` (Equatable). 11 tests in `ConfigTests`.
- [x] `ChromeProfileResolver.swift` ✅ 2026-05-08 — parses Chrome's `Local State` JSON; maps friendly profile names → directory names. Passthrough for unknown values (so `"Profile 4"` and `"Default"` work as escape hatches). Duplicate display names handled deterministically (first-by-directory-key). 12 tests in `ChromeProfileResolverTests`.
- [ ] `State.swift` — `state.json` read/write, first-run capture of `LSCopyDefaultHandlerForURLScheme("http")`
- [ ] `BrowserLauncher.swift` — `open -na <bundle_id> --args [--profile-directory=<profile>] <url>` via `Process`
- [ ] `URLHandler.swift` — register `kAEGetURL` handler, capture source app, resolve via RuleMatcher, launch via BrowserLauncher
- [ ] `AppDelegate.swift` — status-bar item, menu: *Reload config*, *Open config file*, *Set fallback browser →* (submenu of installed browsers), *Quit*

---

## Phase 3 — Polish

- [ ] Config file watcher (`DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource`) for live reload on save
- [ ] *Set fallback browser* submenu writes to `state.json` and updates in-memory state
- [ ] Edge case: `state.json` missing on first launch *because user set us as default before launching us* → enumerate installed browsers via `LSCopyApplicationURLsForURL`, pick first non-`openwith`, surface a one-time menu-bar notice
- [ ] Empty/malformed config → log to `~/.config/openwith/openwith.log`, fall back to direct fallback-browser launch (don't crash, don't drop URLs on the floor)

---

## Phase 4 — Validation

- [ ] Run the full smoke test from the plan's *Verification* section (steps 1–10)
- [ ] Daily-drive for two weeks. Track friction in this file (add a *Field notes* section below).
- [ ] Confirm idle resource cost: `top -pid $(pgrep openwith)` shows < 50MB RSS, ~0% CPU

---

## Phase 5 — Distribution *(deferred — only if Phase 4 earns its keep)*

- [ ] Decide: keep local-only, open-source on GitHub, or Homebrew cask
- [ ] If shipping: code signing, notarization, sparkle/auto-update
- [ ] README, screenshots, example configs
